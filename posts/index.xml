      <description>Introduction Have you ever removed a file with rm [FILENAME] or even worse rm -rf [DIR] only to find out that that you didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backup?. Well this happend to me with a project I hadn&amp;rsquo;t pushed to Github, and could not recover despite my best efforts, coloquially I know that the file wasn&amp;rsquo;t really deleted, it was just stored in unallocated spaces and the pointers from the filesystem datastructures where no longer pointing to it, so the file was recoverable but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to get it back.</description>

      <description>Setup / Prerequisites  A working Kubenetes (GKE) Helm3 KMS Permissions Sops (https://github.com/mozilla/sops/)  Let&amp;rsquo;s Do it! Key Generation First off you need to create a user in IAM with permissions (KMS Admin), and setup gcloud with this user After this, create a key ring and keys with the following comands:
gcloud kms keyrings create helm \  --location us-west1 gcloud kms keys create helm-secrets \  --location us-west1 \  --keyring helm \  --purpose &amp;#34;encryption&amp;#34; --rotation-period &amp;#34;90d&amp;#34; \  --next-rotation-time &amp;#34;2020-05-30T01:00:00&amp;#34; This will create a key ring named helm with a key called helm-secrets in us-west1 with a 90 day rotation period starting on May 30th 2020.</description>
