      <description>Introduction This was my graduate thesis, in which I reversed engineered and android APK application, to then use a metasploit payload to launch malware from the infected app and then proceeded to attempt anti virus evasion.
I go through the android permission model, applicaiton settings and how app signing works. An overview of ARM architecture, to move on to a list of tools I used to reverse engineer, including Metasploit and APKTool.</description>
