      <description>Introduction Have you ever removed a file with rm [FILENAME] or even worse rm -rf [DIR] only to find out that that you didn&amp;rsquo;t have a backup?. Well this happend to me with a project I hadn&amp;rsquo;t pushed to Github, and could not recover despite my best efforts, coloquially I know that the file wasn&amp;rsquo;t really deleted, it was just stored in unallocated spaces and the pointers from the filesystem datastructures where no longer pointing to it, so the file was recoverable but I didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to get it back.</description>
